# Pathfinding Algorithms Visualization

## Project Overview

This project visualizes various pathfinding algorithms on a grid. The goal is to explore and compare different algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS, and their variations. The visualization shows how each algorithm explores the grid and finds the shortest path from a start point to an endpoint. Additionally, the project includes analysis and ranking of the algorithms based on execution time, searched cells, and path cost.
